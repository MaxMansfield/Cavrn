Here is a list of all files with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{a00011}{cavrn.\-h} \\*The main file which defines import macros and contains the \hyperlink{a00005}{Cavrn} structure which is used for enabling and disabling global functions in order to control global facilities which have no place in the other modules as well as unify files and apply various macros, \hyperlink{a00005}{Cavrn} is provided. Use the \hyperlink{a00005}{Cavrn} struct instead of calling its methods directly. Check the examples page for more detail }{\pageref{a00011}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{a00016}{uart.\-h} \\*\hyperlink{a00009}{Uart} uses a variety of internal functions and presents them in the form of a \hyperlink{a00010}{uart\-\_\-t} object called \hyperlink{a00009}{Uart}. To access a function and its operations, simply address the function pointer. Check the examples for more }{\pageref{a00016}}{}
